Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic and potentially life-threatening disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and effective management are crucial to preventing serious complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and vision loss. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on laboratory tests and manual evaluation, which can be time-consuming and may not always detect the disease at an early stage.
With the growing availability of healthcare data, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting and diagnosing diseases like diabetes. By analyzing patient data — including age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other medical attributes — ML models can learn patterns and make accurate predictions about the likelihood of a person developing diabetes.
